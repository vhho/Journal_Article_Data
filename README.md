The data used in this paper includes the following files:

**1) Original KG:** This is a repository of Vietnamese-based triples used as evidence to verify information.

**2) Logical Rules:** This contains the Logical Rules used by Algorithm 2 to infer new triples, Inferred Triples, in the Datalog language.

**3) Complete KG:** This contains the complete data set, Complete KG, which includes the original dataset, Original KG, plus the newly inferred and conflict-tested triples, Validated Triples.

**4) Claim Sentences:** This contains the sentences for fact-checking.
